# FAMD_COMPARISON
This project implements a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) text summarization model using PyTorch. The model is trained on the CNN/DailyMail dataset and leverages a GRU-based architecture for summarizing articles into concise highlights. It includes custom data preparation, training, evaluation, and beam search generation for predictions.
