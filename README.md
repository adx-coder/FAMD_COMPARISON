## README for Summarization Model Training Notebook

### Project Overview
This Jupyter Notebook implements a text summarization model using PyTorch. It trains a GRU-based sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) architecture on the CNN/DailyMail dataset, enabling the generation of concise summaries for articles. The notebook includes data preparation, model training with FMAD (Forward Mode Automatic Differentiation), evaluation using ROUGE metrics, and beam search-based text generation.

---

### Features
- **Data Preparation**: Processes the CNN/DailyMail dataset using the BART tokenizer for input-output pairs.
- **GRU-based Seq2Seq Model**: Encoder-decoder architecture with embedding layers and dropout regularization.
- **Beam Search Generation**: Produces high-quality summaries by exploring multiple candidate sequences.
- **FMAD Training**: Implements advanced gradient computation using `torch.autograd.grad`.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Computes ROUGE scores to measure summarization quality.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone 
   cd 
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install torch transformers torchmetrics datasets jupyter
   ```
3. Open the notebook:

### Usage Instructions
1. **Load Dataset**: The notebook automatically downloads and preprocesses the CNN/DailyMail dataset.
2. **Train Model**: Execute the training cells to train the Seq2Seq GRU model using FMAD-based gradient computation.
3. **Evaluate Model**: Evaluate the model on validation and test splits, computing ROUGE scores for generated summaries.
4. **Generate Summaries**: Use beam search to generate summaries for new input articles.

### Key Components
#### 1. **SummarizationDataset Class**
Handles tokenization of articles and highlights, preparing input-output pairs for training and evaluation.

#### 2. **Seq2SeqGRUModel Class**
Defines a GRU-based encoder-decoder model with embedding layers, dropout regularization, and beam search generation.

#### 3. **FMAD Training Functions**
Implements FMAD-style gradient computation using `torch.autograd.grad` for efficient training.

#### 4. **Evaluation Functions**
Generates summaries and computes ROUGE scores to evaluate performance.

### Hyperparameters
- Embedding Dimension: 256  
- Hidden Dimension: 512  
- Number of Layers: 1  
- Dropout Rate: 0.3  
- Batch Size: 32  
- Learning Rate: 0.003  
- Number of Epochs: 10

### Example Output
After training, the model generates summaries like:
```
Input Article: "The stock market saw a sharp decline today..."
Generated Summary: "Stock market experiences sharp decline."
```
